Title:       Bi-Cross-Validation for the SVD
Author:      Patrick O. Perry
Maintainer:  Patrick O. Perry <patperry@gmail.com>
Description: 
    This package implements methods for choosing the rank of an SVD 
    approximation via cross validation.  It provides both Gabriel-style 
    "block" holdouts and Wold-style "speckled" holdouts.  Also included is an 
    implementation of the SVDImpute algorithm.
